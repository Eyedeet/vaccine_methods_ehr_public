# Identifying vaccinations in EHR data

This repository contains code lists and some example code for data cleaning
of vaccination data in electronig health records (EHRs).



## Code lists
There a four different example code lists folders provided for
 * Measles, mumps and rubella vaccines
 * Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines
 * Vaccines against pneumococcus infections
 * General vaccine terms
Every folder contains example code lists for the different categories which 
can be applied to vaccine code lists.
 


## R scripts
The provided R scripts show three different examples how vaccine data in CPRD
Aurum was cleaned. It also contains many exploratory and descriptive steps
which were used to determine a recommended minimum age and a minimum time 
interval between different doses of the same vaccine type. Depending on the 
vaccine and setting of interest, these steps should be repeated accordingly for
other vaccines or settings.
Interim results of different cleaning steps are included as comments in the
code, however, some numbers were suppressed due to small numbers.
